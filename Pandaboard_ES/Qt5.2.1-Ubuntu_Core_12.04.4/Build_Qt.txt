Build Qt 5.2.1
==============

Make sure you have your native and cross-compilers installed. Ubuntu provides one (so does Linaro):

sudo apt-get g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf build-essential

You will want to mount that rootfs from the previous section to make life easier when building Qt. From above:

mkdir rootfs
sudo mount -o loop,offset=41126400 disk.img rootfs

Now configure (note the last 3 include arguments; these are required due to funky placement of the GBM/DRM headers in 
the TI repository):
./configure -device linux-pandaboard-g++ -nomake tests -nomake examples -prefix /your_path_to_qt -sysroot /your_rootfs_path
-I/your_rootfs_path/usr/include -I/your_rootfs_path/usr/include/gbm -I/your_rootfs_path/usr/include/drm
If all goes well, you should be able to run

make && make install

to finish building Qt. If an important feature is missing (like OpenGL ES 2), run configure with -v for potentially helpful error messages. It should be possible to build OpenGL ES 2 along with the EGLFS, minimal EGL, and KMS QPA plugins.
